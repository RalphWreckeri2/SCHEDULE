# SCHEDULE: Event Registration and Management System

This project is designed to help manage and organize events efficiently. It provides tools for creating, editing, and tracking tasks or events, ensuring better time management and productivity.

Scope:
- The system will allow event organizers to create and manage events.
- Users can register for events, receive notifications, and track their attendance.
- The system will provide automated email confirmations for successful registrations.
- Event handlers can monitor attendance and analyze participant data.

Delimitation:
- The system is limited to online event registration and management; it does not support in-person ticket sales.
- It does not provide payment integration for paid events.
- The project focuses on web-based access and does not include a mobile application.
- QR code check-in and certificate generation are optional features for later implementation.

Perfect for personal or professional use!
